//This program facilitates playing the game 2048. It uses methods to display the board, to see if a direction can be 
//moved, to move each direction (by squeezing out zeros and combining cells in that direction), to see if the game
//has been won, to place a 2 or 4 in a random open space on the board, to see if the game board is in a state in 
//which no more moves are possible, to display help, to undo the last move, to setup a new game, to save the high
//score, to load the high score.
